Take this simple Oregon Trail game and turn it into a video game for artists to play...

Help Quinn XCII Tour the World!

Quinn starts in his tour bus headed to his first show in SF and throughout the journey to the end of the tour Quinn is faced with a variety of obstacles.
For ex: losing his voice, car breaking down, crazy fan meet n greet busts out, throughout all these adversities, Quinn needs your moral support
to pull through and make this tour a tour of a lifetime for everyone. Help Quinn XCII by singing along to his lyrics to help him start and finish the tour.

The Quinn Test Tour Game:

At random points of the tour, you have to guess what song a random lyric is from, if you get it right, Quinn moves forward, if you don't, Quinn risks the chances
of not being able to finish the tour!!
